## Minigame Assignment

### Level Design Choices

Most games have level progression as the primary goal. However, this game has an inverted level paradigm where the end-goal is to avoid progression. As the goal of the game is to defend Earth from an invading force, and you are defending the outer sectors first, the goal is to *avoid* getting closer to Earth, the final level. Because of this, the majority of the level-design concepts present in Chapter 5 do not apply.

That being said, there are plenty of concepts that do apply. For example, each level has the goal of staying alive. As each level's gravity profile will be different (the second level is a binary system, for example), each level presents unique challenges. Some levels will contain thick asteroid fields that deal damaage as the player crosses through them. Others will contain pulsars that produce ion radiation and disable the player's shields.
